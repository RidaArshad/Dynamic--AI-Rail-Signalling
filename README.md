### **AI-Powered Railway Signalling and Platform Management System**  
_Reimagining train operations with adaptive signalling, real-time intelligence, and automated station assistance._

---

## 🧭 Overview

**Dynamic–AI Rail Signalling** is an ongoing research-driven project that integrates **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** with **Dynamic Moving Block Signalling** to revolutionize railway operations and enhance safety, speed, and efficiency.

## Key Challenges in Conventional Railway Operations

### Manual Decision-Making
- Highly subjective and slow response times, prone to human error.

### Fixed-Block Signalling
- Poor track utilization and inflexible block lengths, causing delays.

### Passenger-Freight Conflicts
- Congestion and scheduling inefficiencies reduce overall throughput.

### Rigid Safety Margins
- Overly conservative spacing reduces train density and network capacity.

### Optimized Operations (Goal)
- Addressing these challenges enables increased capacity, higher safety, and improved service quality.

This project overcomes that limitation by implementing **Dynamic Moving Blocks**, where block lengths vary continuously in real time based on:
- Train **speed**
- **Braking distance**
- **Track occupancy**
- **Congestion level**

The system also introduces an **AI Decision Support Engine** that assists **Station Masters** by offering intelligent recommendations for:
- 🚉 Platform allotment  
- 🚦 Signal control decisions  
- 🕒 Train sequencing and prioritization  
- ⚡ Conflict resolution during high traffic
