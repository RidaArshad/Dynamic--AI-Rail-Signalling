### **AI-Powered Railway Signalling and Platform Management System**  
_Reimagining train operations with adaptive signalling, real-time intelligence, and automated station assistance._

---

## 🧭 Overview

**Dynamic–AI Rail Signalling** is an ongoing research-driven project that integrates **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** with **Dynamic Moving Block Signalling** to revolutionize railway operations and enhance safety, speed, and efficiency.

Traditional **Fixed Block Systems** divide railway tracks into rigid, predefined sections, which often leads to underutilization and delays.

This project overcomes that limitation by implementing **Dynamic Moving Blocks**, where block lengths vary continuously in real time based on:
- Train **speed**
- **Braking distance**
- **Track occupancy**
- **Congestion level**

The system also introduces an **AI Decision Support Engine** that assists **Station Masters** by offering intelligent recommendations for:
- 🚉 Platform allotment  
- 🚦 Signal control decisions  
- 🕒 Train sequencing and prioritization  
- ⚡ Conflict resolution during high traffic
